#233

### Briefly explain your program logic - 
This problem is a typical application of segment tree.

We maintain three attributes for each interval:
1. The number of subarray that meet the condition (mark as ans);
2. Starting from the leftmost side, the length of the longest continuous non-decreasing subarray (mark as left_size);
3. Starting from the rightmost, the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray (mark as right_size).
