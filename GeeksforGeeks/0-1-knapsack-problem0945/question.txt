You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have 
only one quantity of each item.
In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value 
subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, 
either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
W = 4
values[] = {1,2,3}
weight[] = {4,5,1}
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
W = 3
values[] = {1,2,3}
weight[] = {4,5,6}
Output: 0
