Datatype - int 
-	Anushka Srivastava
int is a primitive datatype. It stores integer values. The size of int is 4 bytes i.e. 32 bits and the range is -2147483648 (-2^31) to 2147483647(2^31-1).
Example
Declaring a value 
int a = 2230


Write a program to add to integer numbers.

public class Solution
{
 	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    int n1 = 10;
	    int n2 = 20;
	    int sum = n1+n2;
		System.out.println("Sum of two integer number : "+sum);
	}
}

Output
Sum of two integer number : 30

In the above program you can see that we have taken 2 variables of int datatype i.e. n1 , n2 which store integer values , 10 , 20. Then, we have added the two integer value and store it in sum which is also of integer type.

signed int 
It can store signed integers i.e. the values stored can be positive , negative or zero. The range of signed int is  -2147483648 (-2^31) to 2147483647(2^31-1).

unsigned int
It can store unsigned integers i.e. the values can be positive or zero but it can never be negative. The range of unsigned int is  0 to 2147483647.
